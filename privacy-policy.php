                                        How long we retain your personal information<br><br>
                                        We retain the majority of your personal information for as long as your account is active and therefore open; this allows you to continue accessing our content, products and services.

                                        If you become inactive and are not a customer, we may delete elements of the information associated with your account. We will normally warn you if your access is going to be withdrawn and give you the opportunity to retain your account.<br><br>
                                        Where we don’t need to keep all of your information in full, we will obfuscate or aggregate it, for example, web activity logs and survey responses. This is to ensure that we do not retain your information for any longer than is necessary.<br><br>
                                        It is sometimes necessary for us to keep your personal information for longer periods of time, for example:
                                        If there is a statutory requirement to retain it;<br><br>
                                        If we require the information for legal reasons or there is a legitimate business need for us to retain it;
                                        To ensure we do not contact you if you have asked us not to.<br><br>
                                        How we keep your personal information secure<br><br>
                                        We have appropriate technical and administrative security measures in place to help ensure that our customers’ information is protected against unauthorised or accidental access, use, alteration, or loss.
                                        We operate a global business, so your (relevant for EU based businesses) personal information may be processed and stored outside the European Economic Area (EEA). For example, our global customer services team need to access information about you in order to respond to your queries.
